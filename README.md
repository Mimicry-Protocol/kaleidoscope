# Kaleidoscope
Kaleidoscope is an NPM package that aggregates multiple data providers for safely querying metrics for use within prediction markets. 

The main benefit of Kaleidoscope is that it drastically reduces the risks related to:
- price manipulation by a closed-source data provider
- data provider down-time
